				<h1>Lego Drawing</h1>
				<img src="images/lego.jpg" alt="pencil drawing of a lego mini figure" class="round">
				<p>I made this drawing for one of the open ended drawing promts. This is a drawing of a photo I had taken several years prior of a lego mini figure. Overall I didn't think it turned out too bad, but if I were to do it again I would try to smooth out the shading a little bit.</p>

				<h1>Dramatic Portait</h1>
				<img src="images/selfportait.jpg" alt="pencil drawn selfportait of Isaac with a discusted expression" class="round">
				<p>This drawing was in responce to another open ended promt from ART 101. This time I decided to draw a self portait with dramatic lighing and a discusted look. This was my second to last drawing of the class and really showcased how my proportions and shading had improved compared to my first drawing of the class.</p>

				<h1> Final Self Portait</h1>
				<img src="images/selfportraitfinal.jpg" alt="pencil drawn self portait of Isaac made up of almost a hundred textures" class="round">
				<p>This was the final project for ART 101. Another self portait made up of almost a hundred different textures. This was entirely drawn with pencil and took almost a week to complete. This was also drawn on larger eighteen by twenty-four inch paper as opposed to the smaller nine by twelve inch paper, used in most of my other drawings.</p>
