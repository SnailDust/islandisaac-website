				<h1>Low Poly</h1>
				<img src="images/lowpoly.jpg" alt="low poly representation of a cat" class="round">
				<p>One of the projects in my high school graphic design class was to turn an image into a low poly representation. Pictured here is my low poly representation of a metal cat sculpture from our backyard. This project was achieved by making polygons of average color in photoshop until the whole picture was represented by the polygons.</p>

				<h1>Christmas Card</h1>
				<img src="images/christmascard.jpg" alt="picture of a christmas card by Isaac" class="round">
				<p>For this project I was tasked with making a Christmas card. I was trying to emphasize the snow around Christmas with this card.</p>

				<h1>Banners</h1>
				<img src="images/banners.png" alt="six parking lot banners made by Isaac" class="round">
				<p> This is one of the projects that I'm more proud of. At the end of my advanced graphic design class, I made six banner designs to be used in the parking lot and courtyard at the high school. These banners were put up just in time for high school graduation.</p>
