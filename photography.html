				<h1>Night in Winthrop</h1>
				<img src="images/stars.jpg" alt="Photo of the night sky" class="round">
				<p>This is one of my favorite astro-photos that I've been able to capture. I was able to get this shot by combining forty-two individual images into one compound shot. Combining shots in this way allows for a cleaner image with better exposure without the stars streaking in the sky.</p>

				<h1>Fourth of July</h1>
				<img src="images/fireworks.jpg" alt="Fireworks lighting up the night sky" class="round">
				<p>Fireworks are not easy to get good pictures of and this one came out great. I had to use a triopd and manual focus to keep the shot from bluring, and I think the timing was just about right to fully capture the spectacle.</p>

				<h1>Manual Camera Tips</h1>
				<p>Here is a quick overview of the three main settings to control when shooting manual photos.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Aperture</dt>
					<dd>The aperture setting contols how big the opening in the camera lens is. This setting is often represented by a f/number, also known as an f-stop. The small the number the bigger the opening and the more light that is let in. A larger aputure can also create a sallower depth of field, often associated with portrait shots.</dd>
					
					<dt>Shutter Speed</dt>
					<dd>The shutter speed setting controls how long the shutter is open when a picture is taken. This setting is often represented in seconds. The smaller the number the faster the speed and the short that image sensor is exposed. A faster shutter speed can help to freeze motion, but can result in darker images.</dd>
					
					<dt>ISO</dt>
					<dd>The iso setting controls how sensitive the sensor in the camera is. The higher the number the more sensity the sensor is. Higher iso values can brighten an image, but will also introduce noise. Lower iso values will make the images darker, but with less noise. It is important to note, while a lower iso can result in less noise, if it results in an under exposed image, then the iso should be brought up.</dd>
